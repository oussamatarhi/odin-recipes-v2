    <img src="../images/apple-crisp.webp" alt="A trio of white bowls filled with a warm apple crisp, each topped with
    a generous scoop of vanilla ice cream. The apple filling is a golden-brown
    with visible, soft apple slices, and the crumbly oat topping is a deep,
    toasty brown. Two silver spoons rest in the bowls, and a blue plaid napkin
    is visible in the background." height="400">
