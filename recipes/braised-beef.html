    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An elevated version of homestyle pot roast, this braised beef is hearty
        and full of earthy richness. It would pair well with mashed potatoes,
        buttery noodles, or crusty bread.</p>
    <p>Braising is a cooking method that involves slowly cooking meat in a
        covered pot with some sort of liquid. In the case of this recipe, chuck
        roast is braised in a mixture of beef broth and red wine. Braising is
        similar to stewing, but it requires less liquid.</p>
