    <h1>Braised Beef</h1>
    <img src="../images/braised-beef.webp" alt="A rustic white bowl holds a hearty serving of braised beef, topped with
    fresh parsley. The tender, dark beef is nestled on a bed of creamy mashed
    potatoes and surrounded by soft, glazed carrots. A silver fork is on the
    right side of the bowl, which sits on a striped napkin. In the background,
    there is a small plate with slices of crusty bread." height="400">

    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>An elevated version of homestyle pot roast, this braised beef is hearty
        and full of earthy richness. It would pair well with mashed potatoes,
        buttery noodles, or crusty bread.</p>
    <p>Braising is a cooking method that involves slowly cooking meat in a
        covered pot with some sort of liquid. In the case of this recipe, chuck
        roast is braised in a mixture of beef broth and red wine. Braising is
        similar to stewing, but it requires less liquid.</p>
