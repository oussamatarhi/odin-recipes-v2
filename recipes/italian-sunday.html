    <img src="../images/italian-sunday.webp" alt="A high-angle shot of a white
    enamel pot filled with rich, red tomato sauce and large chunks of meat,
    likely meatballs and sausage. The pot sits on a wooden cutting board, which
    also holds a wedge of Parmesan cheese, a sprig of fresh parsley, and a
    sliced loaf of crusty bread. A silver spoon with some sauce on it rests on a
    blue striped napkin next to the pot." height="400">
