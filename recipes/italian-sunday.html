        enamel pot filled with rich, red tomato sauce and large chunks of meat,
        likely meatballs and sausage. The pot sits on a wooden cutting board, which
        also holds a wedge of Parmesan cheese, a sprig of fresh parsley, and a
        sliced loaf of crusty bread. A silver spoon with some sauce on it rests on a
        blue striped napkin next to the pot." height="400">
