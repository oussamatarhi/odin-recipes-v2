# Recipe Website

This project is part of The Odin Project Foundations Curriculum. It focuses on building a simple multi-page website using only HTML. The main index page links to individual recipe pages, each containing meal details and images. The goal of this project is to reinforce essential HTML skills and practice organizing web content effectively.

## Skills and Techniques Demonstrated

-   **HTML Headings** – Structured page content with clear hierarchy using heading tags (`<h1>`–`<h6>`).

-   **HTML Paragraphs** – Added descriptive text to provide context and readability.

-   **Lists** – Used both unordered (`<ul>`) and ordered (`<ol>`) lists to organize ingredients and steps.

-   **Relative Links** – Connected the index page to individual recipe pages for smooth navigation.

-   **HTML Images** – Included images to visually represent each meal and enhance the website’s appearance.

## Purpose

The main objective of this project is to strengthen the understanding of
fundamental HTML concepts through practical application, ensuring a solid
foundation for future web development projects.
